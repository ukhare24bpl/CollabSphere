## **Workflow & Execution**

### **1. User Login & Authentication**
- Users enter their email and password.
- The system verifies credentials and grants access.

### **2. Loading & Displaying Questions**
- Problems are fetched from the PostgreSQL database and displayed dynamically.
- The interface shows the problem statement, input format, output format, and example cases.

### **3. Code Submission & Execution**
- Users write and submit code in the editor.
- The backend processes the code and tests it against predefined input cases.
- If the output matches expected results, the answer is marked as correct.

### **4. Question Progression & Difficulty Scaling**
- Users can move between problems using navigation buttons.
- Difficulty is determined based on the problem index.

### **5. Telegram Notification System**
- When a correct submission is detected, a message is sent via a Telegram bot to notify the user.

## **Technology Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React.js with Vite** for fast rendering and efficient state management.
- **Monaco Editor** for an enhanced coding experience.
- **CSS & Styled Components** for a modern UI.

### **Backend**
- **Flask (Python)** for handling API requests and code execution.
- **FastAPI** (potential microservice integration for scalability).

### **Database**
- **PostgreSQL** to store questions, test cases, and user submissions.

### **Code Execution**
- Uses Pythonâ€™s `subprocess` module to execute user-submitted code securely.
- Ensures isolation of execution environments to prevent security risks.

### **Authentication & Security**
- Basic credential-based authentication (future expansion to JWT tokens for better security).
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for API access control.

### **External Integrations**
- **Telegram API** for sending submission notifications.
